# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-Analysis

Analysis of various Classification, Clustering, and Regression algorithms 

  > Algorithms are analyzed on Fisher Iris, Glass types, Finger Vein and Population data sets.

  > SVM(with linear, RBF, MLP, Quadratic, polynomial kernels), Random Forests, Decision Tree, Linear & Logistic Regression, K-Means, DB-Scan, Nearest neighbor, K-Nearest Neighbor were some of the algorithms analyzed.
  
  > Graphs plotted to find the best features which had accuracies not less than 85%. 

  > Used MATLAB for the analysis.
